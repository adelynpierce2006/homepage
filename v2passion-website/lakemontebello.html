            <p>Lake Montebello is a man-made reservoir on the northeast side of Baltimore City. While there used to be a road around the lake, it has know been closed for more recreational activity space. People mainly visit the lake to walk, run,bike, and rollerblade around its 1.3 mile scenic loop. Though I mainly go there to visit my grandparents. </p>

        <h2>The Baltimore Running Festival</h2>
        

        <div class="otherSource">
            <p>The Baltimore Running Festival is an annual marathon event that goes through Federal Hill, the Inner Harbor, and Lake Montebello. Last year, 12,000 runners participated in the event. When I was little, I would sit outside on my grandparent porch overlooking the lake waiting to spot my grandmother. She has participated in the marathon several times.</p>

        <div class="otherSource">
            <p>Lake Montebello is also where I learned how to ride a bike. I may have fell a few times, but I had tons of fun riding around the lake. There, I figured out that biking riding 90% sending it and 10% balancing. </p>
