        <p class="special">Hello World!</p>

        <p>The hand has become increasingly less present in the web as we know it today. <span class="highlight">Websites are largely automated or built from templates, and the knowledge of how to make a website is relegated to a select few.</span> It has only grown easier to learn how to make websites, but the perceived requirements and expectations for a website have become so convoluted and arcane that many avoid the subject.<br> <br>This course seeks to dispel these ideas and will emphasize the hand-quality of websites by developing an <a href="https://www.rottnestisland.com/see-do/wildlife-nature/quokkas">understanding</a> of the best practices, language, history, and present context of the web. We will examine the space of the web at large and explore and challenge what a website is and can be with the hopes of reclaiming an important creative space.</p>
