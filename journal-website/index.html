        <h2>A Response to "My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?”</h2>
        <h3>1-21-2025</h3>
        <p>It is crazy to think that this reading was published 7 years ago because so much of its commentary aligns with the current state of the World Wide Web. Especially since a lot of people encourage and express themselves through social media sites. Much of which, are run and controlled by private corporations. And it is easy to get caught up in social constructs through those platforms. We become more of a product and less of a user (providing our data and time for free ). It is liberating to know that we have the ability to create our own virtual space. Handmade websites have always been used as a platform for people to express their authentic selves. This article serves as a good reminder that people have the ability to be intentional with their internet activity through “alternative” platforms.<br><br> (Additional Comment: I want my website to be like an archive, a place where I can place some of the things I love. I also like the garden metaphor. I want it to be an intentional space. One that can grow and develop alongside me.)

        <h2>A Response to "A Rant About 'Technology'"</h2>
        <h3>1-21-2025</h3>
        <p>Technology has advanced so much that we forget that inventions, like the web, are actually manmade. This rant reminds me that the web is more accessible than it seems, learning code is an obtainable goal. (In addition to html and css, this article has made me want to continue to work on my python skills too.)</p>

        <h2>A Response to "A Handmade Web"</h2>
        <h3>1-28-2025</h3>
        <p>This reading, much like “My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?”, discusses private social media companies’ role in creating today’s internet social constructs. I particularly took note that handmade websites are meant to be presented such. They  should be constantly under construction,  DIY-coded, and imperfect (much like us). With that being said, I have been overly particular with my passion website. This reading really called out my perfectionistic tendencies. And moving forward ,I am going to challenge myself to build websites with the J.R. Carpenter handmade web mentality. </p>

        <h2>A Response to "Hello World"</h2>
        <h3>2-18-2025</h3>
        <p>This reading was reminded me of Le Guin's "A Rant About 'Technology'", it stresses the fact that technology is manmade. The term "computer" quite literally referred to people who calculated mathematics. I found it interesting that cities were brought up as 'computers' for humans. I think its a good analogy for people who need reasurance when coding (to look at their work as a landscaper), but it does come with its complications. Computers are more controlled and predictable. Operating through the physical world is less predictable, and should not be viewed at with such restrictions. </p>

        <h2>A Response to "A Friend is Writing'"</h2>
        <h3>2-20-2025</h3>
        <p>It was a super overwhelming website to experience as a user. But I think it Copley intended it to be that way. I particularly was fascinated by the encorporation of the ellipses as a design element. It is one of the few messaging features that allow us to know that the person we are talking to is present (digitally). Like with notifications, they create a lot of suspense. Seeing full responses rewards users with dopamine.  </p>
