        <h2>A Response to "My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?”</h2>
        <h3>1-21-2025</h3>
        <p>It is crazy to think that this reading was published 7 years ago because so much of its commentary aligns with the current state of the World Wide Web. Especially since a lot of people encourage and express themselves through social media sites. Much of which, are run and controlled by private corporations. And it is easy to get caught up in social constructs through those platforms. We become more of a product and less of a user (providing our data and time for free ). It is liberating to know that we have the ability to create our own virtual space. Handmade websites have always been used as a platform for people to express their authentic selves. This article serves as a good reminder that people have the ability to be intentional with their internet activity through “alternative” platforms.<br><br> (Additional Comment: I want my website to be like an archive, a place where I can place some of the things I love. I also like the garden metaphor. I want it to be an intentional space. One that can grow and develop alongside me.)

        <h2>A Response to "A Rant About 'Technology'"</h2>
        <h3>1-21-2025</h3>
        <p>Technology has advanced so much that we forget that inventions, like the web, are actually manmade. This rant reminds me that the web is more accessible than it seems, learning code is an obtainable goal. (In addition to html and css, this article has made me want to continue to work on my python skills too.)</p>
