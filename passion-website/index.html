        <h2>A Local Art Nerd's Guide to Baltimore City</h2>

        <p>
            Whenever I introduce myself and where I am from, I have learned to expect the following:
        </p>

        <p>
            “Really?”
        </p>

        <p>
            “Ohhh, how is that? There aren’t a lot of good things going on there.”
        </p>

        <p>
            “Isn’t there like - a lot of crime there?” 
        </p>

        <p>
            “Is it like really like “The Wire”?”
        </p>

        <p>
            People are always surprised to find out that I am proud of being a Baltimorean. And while I love being my city’s hype person, I am getting tired of having to explain that Baltimore is so much more than its negative reputation (and the National Aquarium). So in attempt to disrupt these preconcived notions, here are some of my favorite spots in the city.
